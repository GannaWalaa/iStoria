# iStoria

## When and why we started this project?

This project was initially started in August 2018. It was a final team project that was submitted in a contest after a 1-week training. 

The training was for teenagers high-school girls. The training included learning about basics of git and GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and finally Bootstrap.
## What is the project about?

The project is like an online museum. It is called _iStoria_. The name is inspired from the website telling stories about different Greek gods to the user.

#### What will happen to this project?

As the project was first developed when I was at high school and in a very short time, it wasn't planned and developed well and needs serious updates. 

Updates will include renaming the photos and files to proper names and also dividing the project to proper file structure. Also, GUI will be updated to look more user friendly.
