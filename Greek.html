    <div class="description"><small>Icarus</small><br>
                  Icarus the son of Didalus, tried to escape from Crete with wings of Didalus made of feathers and wax.
                  Didalos warned Icarus to not fly high or very low, Icarus was impressed by the beauty of the sun and
                  flew high, The sun melted wax wings and fell into the sea and died.
                  The myth is a philosophical projection of not greed.</div>
